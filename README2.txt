------------------------   MILLIONS OF VOICES: PART 2   ------------------------
------------------------    VERSION 2.0: DIY EDITION    ------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   RELEASE INFORMATION   --------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file catalogues key information about the various audio tracks included in
this release. Sources are included where known.

It is possible that I might discover new information that will render this file
outdated, so I will upload any changes to an online version here:

https://github.com/pipefan413/millions-of-voices/blob/master/README2.txt


This project has two simple objectives:

	1. Compile a reasonably comprehensive collection of the various audio
	   tracks currently available for the theatrical cuts of the original
	   Star Wars trilogy, including some which have not previously been
	   easily accessible and others which have only been available as part
	   of a different bundled release (njvc's custom Star Wars Despecialized
	   Blu-ray images)

	2. Provide significantly more information about the included audio
	   tracks than has ever been given in any previous release


I intend to migrate the audio tracks included here to a future 35mm restoration
of The Empire Strikes Back (perhaps the currently underway "4K80") but for now,
I have chosen the largest available MKV version of the 720p Despecialized
Edition (v2.0) since that's almost certainly the best available. This is not
identical to the official releases of the MKV as, due to the DIY nature of this
release, I have demuxed all audio except from one track, which is the one that
is closest to the original 1980 theatrical audio that would've been heard in
35mm screenings:

	DTS-HD MA 2.0 1980 stereo mix (from LaserDisc)

This is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio encode of the original 1980 stereo mix
(equivalent to the original theatrical presentation) sourced from LaserDisc. I
believe this is a schorman rip of Japanese LaserDisc SF098-1117 from 1986,
upsampled from the source 44.1kHz to 48kHz for DVD/BD compatibility. I have also
included schorman's original 44.1kHz track for the same mix to match its source
more closely; this has never been included with any video restoration of The
Empire Strikes Back until now.

In fact, none of the FLAC files included here have ever been released alongside
any The Empire Strikes Back preservation. I have encoded these from uncompressed
WAV files provided by schorman. Similarly, Hal 9000's 5.1 mix sourced primarily
from the 1997 Special Edition theatrical surround track has been released on its
own and in a package with other Hal 9000 mixes, but never bundled in with a video
track like it is here. I have also included a 3.0 mix of the 1993 LaserDisc
commentary (put together by schorman) which has never been bundled with the film
until now; this is presented in lossless FLAC at its native LaserDisc sample rate
of 44.1kHz and the 2.0 AC3 version that was already included in mainline releases
of TESB Despecialized v2.0.

Note that the 44.1kHz 16-bit FLAC files sourced from schorman are NOT compatible
with Blu-ray Disc or DVD specification (48kHz) and are provided for LaserDisc
preservation purposes, as they represent the most accurate reproduction of the
discs they are sourced from. They will work with MKV containers but not DVD/BD.
If you are going to burn these tracks onto a fully compatible video disc, use
the 48kHz-converted DTS/AC3 versions instead.

As a wee added bonus, I've also included the "HarmyFilm" logo intro (with the
text that follows it, which is specific to TESB v2.0) previously exclusive to
njvc's custom Blu-ray Disc set.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1980 STEREO MIX   ------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the original stereo audio mix that accompanied 35mm theatrical
screenings of the film upon its release in 1980. The DTS-HD MA version of this
is taken from the mainline MKV release of TESB Despecialized v2.0 but the
44.1kHz FLAC version has never been released with video before, having only
been available from schorman's very thorough and excellent LaserDisc audio
archive.

-----   1980 MONO MIX   --------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the version that was screened in theatres with only mono audio setups.
Like the mono mix of Star Wars, the contents of this mix have been altered
somewhat from the stereo version, but in this case there are not as many
significant changes. For some reason, njvc seems to have excluded this track
from the custom Blu-ray Disc image, but it was included with the mainline Harmy
release of TESB Despecialized v2.0. This is the first time both the mono track
and the commentaries njvc compiled have been included in the same release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1993 HOME VIDEO REMIX   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first in what would turn out to be a long line of remixes that would add new
elements into the film many years after release. For me, personally, the effect
is sometimes similar to seeing '90s CGI in an '80s film (by which I mean: bad)
but not all of the tweaks are especially egregious. The mix itself has also been
altered, however, and I'm not especially keen overall. Judge for yourself!

Note: for both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, there are no 1985
mixes provided here because they appear to be functionally identical to those
films' original 1980 and 1983 mixes respectively (unlike the 1985 home video mix
of Star Wars which was indeed a remix with notable differences).

-----   1980/93 HYBRID 5.1 MIX   -----------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 70mm prints of The Empire Strikes Back had to be locked down first, and as a
result, they're actually missing some scenes that appeared in the 35mm and 16mm
presentations. As a result, the theatrical 6-track audio mix was missing those
sections. In addition, there are no known equivalents to the bootleg recording
of a 70mm screening of Star Wars that facilitated the recreation of that film's
6-track mix, which might have been used to repeat that process for The Empire
Strikes Back or Return Of The Jedi. Therefore, this mix is mostly an upmix of
the 1993 LaserDisc remix (which was presented in 2.0 "Dolby Surround" originally)
with some reversions to earlier elements to suit hairy_hen's preference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1997 SPECIAL EDITION HYBRID 5.1 MIX   ----------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This alternative mix by Hal 9000 uses the 1997 DVD remix as a base from which to
extrapolate a new track that syncs with the theatrical cut (or more
specifically, "George's Original Unaltered Trilogy" or "GOUT") while retaining
elements that were present in the 1997 remix but not in other versions. There
were some new alterations made in 1997 that have been intentionally retained
here, some of which are arguably undesirable. Purists may not love this one, but
it's an impressive and unique piece of work that deserves a shot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   ISOLATED SCORE (2.0 STEREO)   ------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A recreation of the score alone, reconstructed from CD by ABC. Obviously
this contains no dialogue, sound effects or anything else, instead aiming solely
to replicate all of the original theatrical music cues as accurately as
possible. NOTE: I initially erroneously credited this to hairy_hen because I
completely forgot it was ABC who put it together (I probably misremembered this
because hairy_hen did the more recent isolated score for Star Wars), hence the
inaccurate filename. I will fix this in the next release, which is in progress.

-----   1993 AUDIO COMMENTARY   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This official commentary track was recorded for LaserDisc releases that hit the
market in 1993. It has been restored in 3.0 by schorman, with the commentary in
the centre speaker and the 1993 LaserDisc stereo remix in the left and right
channels. A 2.0 stereo mix of this track was included in mainline TESB
Despecialized releases in AC3 format (which is included here as well) but this
3.0 FLAC version has never been released alongside any video restoration of the
original theatrical film before now. Unlike the other FLAC files sourced from
schorman releases, which are 44.1kHz, this one is upsampled to 48kHz so should
work fine on a DVD or Blu-ray Disc (although I haven't tested it myself so
don't necessarily take my word for it).

-----   BONUS COMMENTARIES   ---------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides preservation and clarification of sources, the other main goal of these
releases was to migrate a fairly large collection of commentary tracks from a
set of 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISO images created by njvc as a "collector's edition"
style presentation of Harmy's Despecialized Editions of the original Star Wars
trilogy. The Despecialized Editions are currently 720p files due to significant
variations between quality of sources, and are reconstructions - rather than
restorations - of the original theatrical cuts. My personal preference now is to
instead watch projected 1080p restorations of 35mm theatrical prints such as the
4K scans currently being worked on by Team Negative1. This, combined with the
somewhat unwieldy nature of several 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISOs, prompted me to demux
these audio tracks from the Despecialized Editions and remux them into MKV files
for my preferred versions of the films (currently 4K77 v1.4, TESB Despecialized
v2.0, and 4K83 v1.3).

The following files are all presented in 2.0 stereo AC3 format and are intended
as commentary tracks for various "Special Edition" revisions of the film, as
opposed to the theatrical editions, so they include references to elements not
seen on screen if muxed into any "GOUT" (George's Original Unaltered Trilogy)
video.

Nonethelss, they are generally entertaining and it can be quite amusing to hear
the commentators freaking out about some dumb revision to the film that you
aren't actually seeing onscreen!

HARMY PROUDLY PRESENTS...

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK - DESPECIALIZED EDITION REMASTERED (v2.0)


This is a fan preservation made for culturally historical and educational
purposes. Fanedits and preservations must not be bought or sold. Please report
every fanedit or preservation you find for sale to webmasters of

This is a reconstruction of the 1980 theatrical version of The Empire Strikes
Back. The original shots were painstakingly restored using various sources
(listed below) and the film received an extensive shot by shot colour
correction.

The remastered version (v2.0) represents a significant improvement in picture
quality over the earlier 1.0 version due to the use of better encoding and
higher quality sources and replacing many of the despecialized shots with
higher quality ones.
