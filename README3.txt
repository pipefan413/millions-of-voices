------------------------   MILLIONS OF VOICES: PART 3   ------------------------
------------------------    VERSION 2.0: DIY EDITION    ------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   RELEASE INFORMATION   --------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file catalogues key information about the various audio tracks included in
this release. Sources are included where known.

It is possible that I might discover new information that will render this file
outdated, so I will upload any changes to an online version here:

https://github.com/pipefan413/millions-of-voices/blob/master/README3.txt


This project has two simple objectives:

	1. Compile a reasonably comprehensive collection of the various audio
	   tracks currently available for the theatrical cuts of the original
	   Star Wars trilogy, including some which have not previously been
	   easily accessible and others which have only been available as part
	   of a different bundled release (njvc's custom Star Wars Despecialized
	   Blu-ray images)

	2. Provide significantly more information about the included audio
	   tracks than has ever been given in any previous release

The video file provided is version 1.3 of the 4K83 project with only one audio
track muxed in, which has so far never been included in any official 4K83
release before in this form:

	DTS-HD MA 2.0 1983 stereo mix (from LaserDisc)

This is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio encode of the original 1983 stereo mix
(equivalent to the original theatrical presentation) sourced from US LaserDisc
1478-80, which was previously available only as lossy AC3 at a bitrate of
384kbps. Whether this will represent any discernible improvement in quality
over the AC3 encode is up to you, but I'd rather provide the best quality
available for this particular track as it sounds slightly better to my ears
than the 35mm optical stereo track set as default on mainline 4K83 releases.

None of the FLAC files included here have ever been previously released
alongside any Return Of The Jedi film preservation as far as I know. These are
provided by schorman (44.1kHz LaserDisc tracks and 16mm mono) and hairy_hen
(isolated score). Similarly, Hal 9000's 5.1 mix sourced primarily from the 1997
Special Edition theatrical surround track has been released on its own and in a
package with other Hal 9000 mixes, but never bundled in with a video track like
it is here.

Note that the 44.1kHz 16-bit FLAC files provided by schorman are NOT compatible
with Blu-ray Disc or DVD specification (48kHz) and are provided for LaserDisc
preservation purposes, as they represent the most accurate reproduction of the
discs they are sourced from. They will work with MKV containers but not DVD/BD.
If you are going to burn these tracks onto a fully compatible video disc, use
the 48kHz-converted DTS/AC3 versions instead.

Another notable inclusion is the first 4K83 version of hairy_hen's 5.1 surround
mix, in which he included an additional John Williams music cue composed for
the Obi-Wan scene on Dagobah but which went unused in all official releases of
the film for some reason. This "Message From A Jedi" mix (as I've decided to
call it) was muxed into earlier 4K83 releases prior to v1.3 by default, and was
included in v1.3 but only as lossy AC3 as opposed to its original lossless
24-bit DTS-HD Master Audio presentation. For this new Millions Of Voices
release, both this and hairy_hen's later, more "authentic" version are included
as lossless DTS-HD Master Audio tracks at a BD/DVD-compatible 48kHz sample rate.

As a wee bonus, I've also stripped the audio track out of the BBFC card so it
matches the silent one for 4K77 (it was noise anyway rather than actual audio
information printed onto the film). Both versions are included... you choose!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   A BRIEF INTERRUPTION: 4K83 VS GOUT   -----------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A NOTE FOR THE PICKY: 4K83 is not synced to "GOUT" as the GOUT version of ROTJ
turned out to be missing 2 frames 47 minutes and 43 seconds in, which have been
recovered from the source print used in 4K83 and are therefore present in this
release. This does not affect the main soundtracks, but it does mean that the
commentary tracks (apart from the 1993 LaserDisc one) and the isolated score
will end up 2 frames out of sync with the picture by the end. If you understand
how quickly 2 frames pass in terms of time, you will likely find this to be a
non-issue, but if you are bothered by the discrepancy then CatBus has your back
with a GOUT-synced version of 4K83 v1.1 which you can remux the score/commentary
tracks into if you prefer:

http://www.myspleen.org/details.php?id=34872

Anyway, on to the audio tracks!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1983 STEREO MIX   ------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the original stereo audio mix that accompanied 35mm theatrical
screenings of the film upon its release in 1983. Neither version of the
LaserDisc track presented here has ever been released with any Return Of The
Jedi video preservation before, having only been available from schorman's very
thorough and excellent LaserDisc audio archive.

I did not see much point in including the lossy AC3 version from mainline 4K83
releases since that's readily available already and is objectively lossier
(though not necessarily subjectively better to the ears, depending on the
listener). I have, however, included 4K83's 35mm optical audio track (the
default option on mainline 4K83 releases) as an alternative for you to compare
with the LaserDisc master and see which you prefer.

-----   1983 MONO MIX   --------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the version that was screened in theatres with only mono audio setups.
Like the mono mix of Star Wars, the contents of this mix have been altered
somewhat from the stereo version, but in this case there are not as many
significant changes. In this case, there are however some things *missing* from
the mono mix that are present in the stereo ones, rather than this being the
most complete mix (as the 1977 mono mix for Star Wars was).

The encode of this that appears in mainline 4K83 releases is lossy AC3, making
this the first release to feature a lossless version instead!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1993 HOME VIDEO REMIX   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first in what would turn out to be a long line of remixes that would add new
elements into the film many years after release. For me, personally, the effect
is sometimes similar to seeing '90s CGI in an '80s film (by which I mean: bad)
but not all of the tweaks are especially egregious. The mix itself has also been
altered, however, and I'm not especially keen overall. Judge for yourself!

Note: for both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, there are no 1985
mixes provided here because they appear to be functionally identical to those
films' original and 1983 mixes respectively (unlike the 1985 home video mix
of Star Wars which was indeed a remix with notable differences).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1983/93 HYBRID 5.1 MIXES   ---------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no known equivalents to the bootleg recording of a 70mm screening of
Star Wars that facilitated the recreation of that film's 6-track mix, which
might have been used to repeat that process for The Empire Strikes Back or
Return Of The Jedi. Therefore, this mix is mostly an upmix of the 1993 LaserDisc
remix (which was presented in 2.0 "Dolby Surround" originally) with some
reversions to earlier elements to suit hairy_hen's preference.

There are two versions of this mix presented here, with only one very specific
and localised difference between them. This is because when hairy_hen initially
completed the new revision of the mix for 4K83's first release, they also added
in a music cue written by John Williams for Obi-Wan's scene on Dagobah which
went unused in every official release of Return Of The Jedi for unknown reasons.
This was done purely for hairy_hen's own personal enjoyment, but it accidentally
ended up in 4K83 before the mistake was noticed. It was later reverted back to
be closer to the official audio mixes of the film. I actually love the effect
this tiny piece of hitherto forgotten music has on the scene (filling an
otherwise slightly odd silence behind the dialogue) so this has become my own
favourite mix as a result! However, those who would prefer a more "authentic"
experience can use the version that's been used in mainline 4K83 releases since
v1.3 instead. Both appear here encoded in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio at 48kHz
and hairy_hen's personal "Message From A Jedi" mix is 24-bit (having been only
16-bit in mainline 4K83 releases).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1997 SPECIAL EDITION HYBRID 5.1 MIX   ----------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This alternative mix by Hal 9000 uses the 1997 DVD remix as a base from which to
extrapolate a new track that syncs with the theatrical cut (specifically, *this*
version of the theatrical cut, including the 2 additional frames that 4K83 has
over the 2006 "GOUT" cut) while retaining elements that were present in the 1997
remix but not in other versions. There were some new alterations made in 1997
that have been intentionally retained here, some of which are arguably
undesirable. Purists may not love this one, but it's an impressive and unique
piece of work that deserves a shot.

-----   ISOLATED SCORE (2.0 STEREO)   ------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A recreation of the score alone, reconstructed from CD by hairy_hen. Obviously
this contains no dialogue, sound effects or anything else, instead aiming solely
to replicate all of the original theatrical music cues as accurately as
possible.

As mentioned near the top of this document, remember that this is synced to
"GOUT", which means it's missing 2 frames at 47:43, although this is especially
unlikely to be noticeable with this score-only track.

-----   1993 AUDIO COMMENTARY   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This official commentary track was recorded for LaserDisc releases that hit the
market in 1993. It has been restored in 3.0 by schorman, with the commentary in
the centre speaker and the 1993 LaserDisc stereo remix in the left and right
channels. This is included in mainline 4K83 releases in AC3 format but has been
made available here in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio as well. As an alternative
option, a 2.0 stereo downmix is also included in AC3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   BONUS COMMENTARIES   ---------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides preservation and clarification of sources, the other main goal of these
releases was to migrate a fairly large collection of commentary tracks from a
set of 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISO images created by njvc as a "collector's edition"
style presentation of Harmy's Despecialized Editions of the original Star Wars
trilogy. The Despecialized Editions are currently 720p files due to significant
variations between quality of sources, and are reconstructions - rather than
restorations - of the original theatrical cuts. My personal preference now is to
instead watch projected 1080p restorations of 35mm theatrical prints such as the
4K scans currently being worked on by Team Negative1. This, combined with the
somewhat unwieldy nature of several 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISOs, prompted me to demux
these audio tracks from the Despecialized Editions and remux them into MKV files
for my preferred versions of the films (currently 4K77 v1.4, TESB Despecialized
v2.0, and 4K83 v1.3).

The following files are all presented in 2.0 stereo AC3 format and are intended
as commentary tracks for various "Special Edition" revisions of the film, as
opposed to the theatrical editions, so they include references to elements not
seen on screen if muxed into any "GOUT" (George's Original Unaltered Trilogy)
video. Nonethelss, they are generally entertaining and it can be quite amusing
to hear the commentators freaking out about some dumb revision to the film that
you aren't actually seeing onscreen!

As mentioned near the top of this document, remember that these being synced to
"GOUT" means that they're all missing 2 frames at 47:43, although this is
unlikely to be noticeable  tracks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.3 minimal NR
This is my minimal NR (Noise Reduction) version. The print capture that we used
had some chroma noise added by the camera used to capture it. This version
attempts to remove the chroma noise but preserve as much of the original grain
and detail as possible. A 15% Temporal NR was applied in Neat Video. Doing any
kind of NR softens the grain and image. I applied some sharpening in Neat Video
to sharpen the detail but not the grain. It should be a bit sharper than v1.0
or v1.1.

The colour for the most part is sanjuro_61's grade (v1.1). I made a few tweaks
throughout. I also applied a contrast curve to brighten it up a bit. I retained
the existing black levels though. 

I removed the reel change markers. I felt they were important to preserve for
my previous releases but now we can move on to a cleaner look. 

The 5.1 track is swapped with the more authentic version that was in the
alternate audio folder previously. 

v1.3 file names...
03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.2160p.UHD.35mm.minimalNR.x265-v1.3.mkv
03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.1080p.35mm.minimalNR.x264-v1.3.mkv <--- this version


v1.2 (and v1.2.2) DNR
That is a full DNR release by SkyDude. Colour is mostly sanjuro_61's but tweaked
by SkyDude to improve upon it. More info can be found with that version.


v1.1 DNR
A DNR version was created of v1.1. A Team effort by williarob and SkyDude. More
info can be found with that version.


v1.1 changes
Color Timing: This is a shot-by-shot color grade by sanjuro_61. It is graded
off of the master files and not on top of v1.0.
Cropping is different. I started from scratch. Most shots probably show a bit
more of the frame.
Reels 1 and 2, I used Corner Positioner in Fusion in Resolove to align them.
In v1.0 I only rotated the frame to correct them but they were still slightly
skewed. Reels 6 and 7 are slightly rotated in this version to straighten them
out.
Reel 1 I did a bit more dirt cleanup. Reel 7 I fixed most of the frozen
"dancing" pixels.
Mono audio mix muxed in.
The LD audio track muxed in is the 1983 LD audio rather than the 1993 LD audio.

v1.1 file names...
03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.2160p.UHD.35mm.x265-v1.1.mkv
03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.1080p.35mm.x264-v1.1.mkv   <--- this version


v1.0 info below
The goal of Project 4K83 is simply to create a version of the 1983 Pre-Special 
Edition version of Return of the Jedi that will look good on a 4K television or
monitor.

This project is being rendered at 1080p and 4k UHD (2160p).
These are the final media files as follows:

03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.2160p.UHD.35mm.x265-v1.0.mkv
03-Return.of.the.Jedi.4K83.1080p.35mm.x264-v1.0.mkv

99.9% of all frames used in this project are sourced from one original 1983
35mm Eastman print. The remaining 175 frames were sourced from an alternate
35mm print. All frames were scanned, cleaned, stabilized, and color corrected
in 4k (anamorphic) from 35mm prints. The primary print used is NOT a release
print but a special screening print struck directly from the original film
negative in 1983. It is presented with it's original film grain intact which is
two generations less than what a theatrical release print would have and only
one generation from the original negative. 

No digital noise reduction (DNR) or sharpening has been applied to the film

Color Timing: The color correction has been done on a reel-to-reel basis
(mostly). This preserves the color variations from shot to shot as they would
have been seen in theatres in 1983. A few deviations from the reel-to-reel
correction have been made to better conform to a TV/monitor environment, plus
other minor adjustments. For the most part it is a reel-to-reel color
correction.

This project is not GOUT-synced. The GOUT version of this film is missing two
frames that were seen in theatres. This project presents those two original
theatrical frames for film and historical accuracy. Muxing in alternate GOUT
synced audio to this project will slightly alter the audio sync by two frames.
Most people won't notice a two frame shift in audio sync. The two extra frames
are located at time 00:47:41.

All audio provided is synced to 4K83. Thank you hairy_hen and schorman.
