--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   RELEASE INFORMATION   --------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file catalogues key information about the various audio tracks included in
this release. Sources are included where known.

It is possible that I might discover new information that will render this file
outdated, so I will upload any changes to an online version here:

https://github.com/pipefan413/millions-of-voices/blob/master/README1.txt


This project has two simple objectives:

	1. Compile a reasonably comprehensive collection of the various audio
	   tracks currently available for the theatrical cuts of the original
	   Star Wars trilogy, including some which have not previously been
	   easily accessible and others which have only been available as part
	   of a different bundled release (njvc's custom Star Wars Despecialized
	   Blu-ray images)

	2. Provide significantly more information about the included audio
	   tracks than has ever been given in any previous release


The video file provided is version 1.4 of the 4K77 project with only one audio
track muxed in, which is the same as the default track included in mainline 4K77
releases (although it's labelled differently here):

	DTS-HD MA 2.0 1977 stereo mix (from LaserDisc)

In mainline 4K77 releases, this is "2.0 DTS-HD-MA (1977 35mm stereo mix 2018)".

None of the FLAC files included here have ever been previously released
alongside any Star Wars film preservation as far as I am aware. These are
provided by schorman (44.1kHz LaserDisc tracks) and hairy_hen (isolated score).
Similarly, Hal 9000's 5.1 mix sourced primarily from the 1997 Special Edition
theatrical surround track has been released on its own and in a package with
other Hal 9000 mixes, but never bundled in with a video track like it is here. I
have also included two new alternative versions of schorman's 1993 LaserDisc
commentary track, which was included in 4K77 as lossy AC3 but has also been
presented here as a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0 48kHz/24-bit file and an
alternative AC3 file downmixed from 3.0 to 2.0 for those without a centre
speaker.

Note that the 44.1kHz 16-bit FLAC files provided by schorman are NOT compatible
with Blu-ray Disc or DVD specification (48kHz) and are provided for LaserDisc
preservation purposes, as they represent the most accurate reproduction of the
discs they are sourced from. They will work with MKV containers but not DVD/BD.
If you are going to burn these tracks onto a fully compatible video disc, use
the 48kHz-converted DTS/AC3 versions instead.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   MAY 1977 STEREO MIX   --------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the original stereo audio mix that accompanied 35mm theatrical
screenings of the film during its initial limited release and beyond. The main
source for the 4K77 project was a Spanish print, so the audio was not
particularly useful for the purposes of the project, so this English track was
sourced from LaserDisc instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   JUNE 1977 MONO MIX   ---------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time significant revisions were made to a Star Wars film after
release! Turns out somebody (George Lucas and/or Ben Burtt) wasn't happy with
the original stereo and 6-track mixes and decided to produce a new version in
the interim period between the initial limited release of the film in May of
1977 and its wider release in June. Since the majority of theatres at the time
were equipped with comparatively sub-optimal Academy mono audio gear, these
changes were incorporated into the mono mix presented here, which has never been
officially released on home video. This wasn't just a question of remixing the
same stems, to be clear: alternative takes of dialogue were used, additional
lines were incorporated, and so on. Lucas apparently considered this to be the
"definitive" mix, presumably because of the extra work put into it and because
in 1977, surround sound was commonly thought of as a passing fad that wouldn't
pan (sorry) out. As it stands, this is in fact my favourite mix for Star Wars,
as it's the most complete one that doesn't ruin the authenticity for me by
including changes that date it to a noticeably later point in time.

There are other sources for this now, which come from 16mm prints, but inherent
limitations of the 16mm format mean they sound quite inferior overall compared
with this VHS/CD reconstruction completed by Belbucus way back in 2007, in my
opinion at least. For example, there is significant distortion apparent on just
about everything, which is especially bothersome on dialogue; presumably this is
down to the lower fidelity of the analogue source. I have therefore not included
any true 16mm tracks for this film, although I have for the other two due to the
lack of a better alternative for them.

-----   1985 HOME VIDEO REMIX   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stereo mix was tweaked again for home video releases in 1985. Notably, it
now incorporates at least one change introduced by the mono mix: C-3PO's
explanatory line about the tractor beam control terminals.

Another in what would turn out to be a long line of remixes. This one adds in a
bunch of new sound effects which either improve or detract from the experience
of watching the film depending on one's point of view. For me, personally, the
effect is similar to seeing '90s CGI in a '70s film (by which I mean: bad).
Judge for yourself!

-----   MAY 1977 70MM 6-TRACK MIX   --------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Star Wars was first released in May 1977, a select number of theatres
kitted out with the requisite equipment presented the film in high-fidelity 70mm
film format. These screenings were accompanied, where possible, by a unique
6-track audio mix specially created for this purpose. The trouble is, since this
was never released outside of cinemas, there is no direct source from which to
draw a 100% accurate representation of this mix. This version is an attempt by
hairy_hen to reconstruct the 1977 6-track mix as accurately as possible, using
what we do know about it to extrapolate. For example, an in-cinema bootleg
recording revealed that it bears significant resemblance to the 1993 LaserDisc
remix, which it seems may have been created from the same mix stems, so that
remix was used as the base source with patching from several other earlier
sources to undo changes that were made in the intervening years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   1997 SPECIAL EDITION HYBRID 5.1 MIX   ----------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This alternative mix by Hal 9000 uses the 1997 DVD remix as a base from which to
extrapolate a new track that syncs with the theatrical cut (or more
specifically, "George's Original Unaltered Trilogy" or "GOUT") while retaining
elements that were present in the 1997 remix but not in other versions. Notably,
this means that it includes many of the changes that were made way back in 1977
for the mono mix, but in 5.1 surround! Be aware however that there were also
other new alterations made in 1997 that have been intentionally retained here,
some of which are arguably undesirable. Purists may not love this one, but it's
an impressive and unique piece of work that deserves a shot.

-----   ISOLATED SCORE (2.0 STEREO)   ------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new 2018 remaster of hairy_hen's 2013 isolated score track. Obviously this
contains no dialogue, sound effects or anything else, instead aiming solely to
replicate all of the original theatrical music cues as accurately as possible
and in the highest available quality. Lossy AC3 (smaller) and lossless FLAC
(higher fidelity) encodes are included.

CRED:	hairy_hen

INFO:	"This is an updated version of the one I made back in 2013. It is
	sourced entirely from the special edition 2-CD set (the 2004 Sony
	release, since that is the only copy of the soundtrack I had back then).
	I later thought about replacing some sections with the older Anthology
	set, but since that one is edited differently and often uses alternate
	takes that don't appear in the actual movie, I didn't think it would
	really be worth it. So this new isolated score still uses all the same
	edits as the previous one; the update comes from what was done to
	improve the sound quality."

-----   1993 AUDIO COMMENTARY   ------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This official commentary track was recorded for LaserDisc releases that hit the
market in 1993. It has been restored in 3.0 by schorman, with the commentary in
the centre speaker and the 1993 LaserDisc stereo remix in the left and right
channels. This is included in mainline 4K77 releases in AC3 format but has been
made available here in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio as well. As an alternative
option, a 2.0 stereo downmix is also included in AC3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----   BONUS COMMENTARIES   ---------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides preservation and clarification of sources, the other main goal of these
releases was to migrate a fairly large collection of commentary tracks from a
set of 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISO images created by njvc as a "collector's edition"
style presentation of Harmy's Despecialized Editions of the original Star Wars
trilogy. The Despecialized Editions are currently 720p files due to significant
variations between quality of sources, and are reconstructions - rather than
restorations - of the original theatrical cuts. My personal preference now is to
instead watch projected 1080p restorations of 35mm theatrical prints such as the
4K scans currently being worked on by Team Negative1. This, combined with the
somewhat unwieldy nature of several 50GB Blu-ray Disc ISOs, prompted me to demux
these audio tracks from the Despecialized Editions and remux them into MKV files
for my preferred versions of the films (currently 4K77 v1.4, TESB Despecialized
v2.0, and 4K83 v1.3).

The following files are all presented in 2.0 stereo AC3 format and are intended
as commentary tracks for various "Special Edition" revisions of the film, as
opposed to the theatrical editions, so they include references to elements not
seen on screen if muxed into any "GOUT" (George's Original Unaltered Trilogy)
video.

Nonethelss, they are generally entertaining and it can be quite amusing to hear
the commentators freaking out about some dumb revision to the film that you
aren't actually seeing onscreen!

The goal of Project 4K77 is simply to create a version of the 1977 Pre-Special 
Edition version of Star Wars that will look good on a 4K television or monitor.

Scanned, cleaned and rendered at 4K, the material is sourced primarily from two 
original 35mm Technicolor prints, with additional material taken from the 35mm 
Spanish LPP, a 4K scan of a 1997 Special Edition print, some Eastman reels, and
just a handful of frames from the Official Blu-Ray when missing frames could
not be sourced from anywhere else.

Versions of the project include 1080p and 4K renders with and without digital
noise reduction. These are titled as follows:

Star.Wars.4K77.2160p.UHD.No-DNR.35mm.x265-v1.0

Star.Wars.4K77.2160p.UHD.No-DNR.35mm.x265-v1.4    

All material has been GOUT-synced, meaning it is compatible with muxing in
your favorite GOUT-synced audio and subtitles, if they aren't already included.
